## My process

This time i just setted up the project, taking as a blueprint the last one. This was very simple but always helpful project and I set an estimated time of 4 hours. Today, my workflow this time was mobile first, never used it and i want to try it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

Mobile Workflow it's a pretty way to work, really feel it faster than the last time, when i was doing mobile and destkop at the same time. I tried to use `flex-wrap` instead of changing `flex-direcion` on desktop and mobile, and it worked pretty well.
